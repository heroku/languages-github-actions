    # This input is currently the only way we can modify which branch to install the CLI tooling from. Ideally we
    # would be able to use [`job_workflow_sha`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context)
    # and always install from the same branch as the workflow but, due to a [bug](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/2417)
    # in the GitHub Action runner, the value is never populated :(
