## Workflows

### Required Configuration

Before using the shared workflows below, please be sure to configure the following settings in your repository:

* [Edit the branch protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule#editing-a-branch-protection-rule)
  on the default branch (e.g.; `main`). If **Restrict who can push to matching branches** and **Restrict pushes that create matching branches** is checked, then add the bot user
  of the GitHub Application that will be used to create pull requests and commits (e.g.; `heroku-linguist`).
* [Configure PR merges](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-auto-merge-for-pull-requests-in-your-repository#managing-auto-merge)
  to **Allow auto-merge**.

> If either of these settings are misconfigured you will encounter errors during steps that
> create or configure pull requests. For example, an error message of **"Pull request User is
> not authorized for this protected branch"** indicates the branch protection rules are missing
> the GitHub Application bot user.

### Buildpacks - Prepare Release

Prepares a buildpack release by:
- bumping the fixed version
- updating changelogs
- generating an aggregate changelog from all the changelogs
- opening a PR against the repository with the modified files

You can pin to:
- the [latest release](https://github.com/heroku/languages-github-actions/releases/latest) version with `@latest`
- a [specific release](https://github.com/heroku/languages-github-actions/releases) version with `@v{major}.{minor}.{patch}`
- the development version with `@main`

#### Example Usage

```yaml
name: Prepare Buildpack Releases

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      bump:
        description: "Bump"
        required: true
        default: 'patch'
        type: choice
        options:
          - major
          - minor
          - patch

# Disable all GITHUB_TOKEN permissions, since the GitHub App token is used instead.

### Buildpacks - Release

Performs the release steps for one or more buildpacks by:

* Detecting all the buildpacks in a repository and compiling them into Cloud Native Buildpacks
* For each compiled buildpack:
  * Creating a CNB archive file from the compiled buildpack and publishing it as a GitHub Release
  * Creating an OCI image from the compiled buildpack and publishing it to the Docker Hub repository specified in the buildpack's `buildpack.toml`
    > The following metadata is used for declaring the registry:
    >
    > ```toml
    > [metadata.release]
    > image = { repository = "docker.io/heroku/buildpack-example" }
    > ```
  * Retrieving the OCI image url published to Docker Hub and registering this with the CNB Registry
* Once all buildpacks have been published, all the buildpack references found in [heroku/cnb-builder-images](https://github.com/heroku/cnb-builder-images)
  are updated for the given list of builders and a pull request is opened containing all the changes to be committed.

You can pin to:
- the [latest release](https://github.com/heroku/languages-github-actions/releases/latest) version with `@latest`
- a [specific release](https://github.com/heroku/languages-github-actions/releases) version with `@v{major}.{minor}.{patch}`
- the development version with `@main`

### Classic Buildpack - Prepare Release

Prepares a "classic" buildpack release by:
- updating the changelog
- opening a PR against the repository with the modified files

You can pin to:
- the [latest release](https://github.com/heroku/languages-github-actions/releases/latest) version with `@latest`
- a [specific release](https://github.com/heroku/languages-github-actions/releases) version with `@v{major}.{minor}.{patch}`
- the development version with `@main`

#### Example Usage

```yaml
name: Prepare Buildpack Release

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  prepare-release:
    uses: heroku/languages-github-actions/.github/workflows/_classic-buildpack-prepare-release.yml@latest
    secrets: inherit
```

#### Inputs

| Name                    | Description                                                                                                                    | Required | Default |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|
| `custom_update_command` | An additional command to run before changes are committed, which can make use of the env vars EXISTING_VERSION and NEW_VERSION | false    |         |

In addition, the workflow requires that the `LINGUIST_*` env vars are available (which are set as organization variables).

#### Secrets

The workflow requires that `inherit` mode be enabled, so that it can access the `LINGUIST_GH_PRIVATE_KEY` organization secret.

## Development

Custom actions are written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and compiled into a command-line application that
exposes the following sub-commands:

```
Usage: actions <COMMAND>

Commands:
  generate-buildpack-matrix  Generates a JSON list of buildpack information for each buildpack detected
  generate-changelog         Generates a changelog from one or more buildpacks in a project
  prepare-release            Bumps the version of each detected buildpack and adds an entry for any unreleased changes from the changelog
  update-builder             Updates all references to a buildpack in heroku/cnb-builder-images for the given list of builders
  help                       Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```
